## Current
Currently I am a senior going into my last four classes as a Northwest Bearcat. I am pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science with a General emphasis. 

## Background
I am from Kansas City, Missouri and Nortwest Missouri State is the first and only university that I have attended. Some people do not know this, but I originally came to Northwest on a football scholarship. Later after my first year I decided that my future life plans \(getting married and graduating early\) did not align with the student-athlete lifestyle, and therefore made the hard decision to quit playing. I now have been actively working two jobs for the last two years, and in my free time I really enjoy going disc golfing on the full 18-hole course in the North-West corner of campus. 

## Plans
I have a passion for software engineering and I believe I have the creativity to excel in this area. This is always subject to change, for I currently work as a PC Technician at Nucor-LMP, also after taking Big Data I may have an interest in becoming a Data Engineer or Data Analyst!

What is Big Data?
The Five V's: <br />
- Velocity: the speed data accumulates
- Volume: scale of the increasing storage of data
- Variety: the diversity of data (structured and unstructured)
- Veracity: conformity to facts/accuracy
- Value: the benefits of evaluating the data

A common application of big data are Recommendation Engines, which are used for a lot of marketing purposes based upon the streamed data that is popular to a particular individual's device. Another may be Virtual assistants such as Alexa or Siri. 

Cloud computing has contributed hugely to the launch of the Big Data era. This lowers the price of storage and computing. 

Sources of Big Data: 
1. People-generated data
2. Machine-generated data
3. Business-generated data

- Structured
    - Data that is organized, labeled, and follows a strict model
    - ex: relational databases and spreadsheets
- Unstructured 
    - Makes up approximately 80% of data in the world
    - Given in a text form and does not have a predefined model
    - ex: square kilometer array, data explosion, social media
- Semi-structured
    - Combination of structured and unstructured
    - ex: XML or JSON
