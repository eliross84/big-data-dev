## Current
Currently I am a senior going into my last four classes as a Northwest Bearcat. I am pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science with a General emphasis. 

## Background
I am from Kansas City, Missouri and Nortwest Missouri State is the first and only university that I have attended. Some people do not know this, but I originally came to Northwest on a football scholarship. Later after my first year I decided that my future life plans \(getting married and graduating early\) did not align with the student-athlete lifestyle, and therefore made the hard decision to quit playing. I now have been actively working two jobs for the last two years, and in my free time I really enjoy going disc golfing on the full 18-hole course in the North-West corner of campus. 

## Plans
I have a passion for software engineering and I believe I have the creativity to excel in this area. This is always subject to change, for I currently work as a PC Technician at Nucor-LMP, also after taking Big Data I may have an interest in becoming a Data Engineer or Data Analyst!
